# NEEDED DAT!

Getting a win over the weekend vs Ben was HUGE, instead of 1-4 we are 2-3 and grab a big game against the person in first place who is also in my division. 157 - 99 was the final but it was a lot closer all day long & game didnt get out of reach until the 1pm games were ending.

My gamble on Taysom Hill payed off big time 33pts (4TDs) and I really like the role they are using him in, for both fantasy production and pure enjoyment watching him run through grown men who know he is about to run the ball down the gut. The threat he poses in the redzone ALONE may put him into TE1 range, if the Saints continue to run QB power inside the 10. It will be interesting to see if Hill's role expands / decreases when Jamies Winston is back, but I don't see why QB1 coming back would be anything but good, b/c of the fact that Taysom won't have to be the backup (ICE) so in essance that shoud mean the coaching staff would be less worried about Taysom getting hurt and give him more run, right? I love me some QB-power and pray that I did not just jynx everything by writing this.
