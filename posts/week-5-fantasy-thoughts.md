# Week 5 Fantasy Football

Coming into the week with a 1-3 record up against Benny T who is 4-0.
Team 'Tampa Gay' possibly already had the best team in the league before getting even better and adding two STUDS.
Benny T acquired CMC & AJ Brown in a trade this past week with Comish, while giving up Jamal Williaims, Joe Mixon, Rashod Bateman, & Marquise Brown.
I like where Andy is going w/ this but just am not sure he chose the right deal. Mixon is Mixon, Jamal Williams has had big numbers but also is getting every goal line carry which I dont see keeping up. I could be very wrong, but it still would be weird spot for andy b/c he has Swift and Williams. So the question is will the Lions be able to sustain two starting caliber RB's for fantasy? I honestly like the Bateman pickup b/c he is getting touches all over the field and has a shot to be a top-10 wr in fantasy this year w/ the role he has on that team. AJ Brown being on Bens team just gives him that scary Hurts/Brown duo that could just fuck you at any given moment. I get the trade for both teams but think Ben wins this one.

Kyle Pitts is hurt and we need to stream a TE and don't love the options on wavier wire, but I do love someone who is listed at TE who is actually a QB.
I am simply in love w/ the idea of Taysom Hill at TE, especially if Kamara is out / still hurt.
Also the fact that Andy Dalton is starting means that the Saints will probably call Taysom's number more and possibly even just run him out as QB1
The idea of seeing my TE line-up in QB-Power near the goal-line is the absolute dream & I can not pass this up.
